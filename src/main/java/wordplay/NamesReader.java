/**
 * This class reads CSV files and returns a list of names from the file.
 *
 * The file is assumed to contain a header row, which is skipped. Each row
 * contains the name and the number of people with that name, separated by a
 * semicolon. For example: "Anne;123" or "Tuula;111".
 *
 * The returned list contains the names in the same order as they appear in the
 * file. The number of people with that name is not included. For example:
 * ["Anne", "Tuula"]
